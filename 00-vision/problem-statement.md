# Problem Statement

## Background
Engineering teams frequently encounter recurring Azure infrastructure and platform issues. 
Troubleshooting steps are often shared through informal channels such as chats, emails, or personal notes.

## Problem
There is no centralized, searchable, and structured system to capture and reuse Azure troubleshooting knowledge.
As a result:
- Engineers spend time re-investigating previously solved issues
- Knowledge is lost when engineers move teams or leave
- Troubleshooting quality varies between engineers

## Impact
The lack of a reusable troubleshooting repository leads to:
- Increased mean time to resolution (MTTR)
- Repeated production incidents for the same root causes
- Inconsistent troubleshooting approaches across teams

## Desired Outcome
Create a centralized knowledge base where:
- Engineers can document troubleshooting steps with context and outcomes
- Troubleshooting knowledge is searchable and easy to discover
- Repeated issues can be resolved faster using proven steps

## Success Criteria
The solution will be considered successful when:
- Engineers can search and find relevant troubleshooting steps within seconds
- Recurring issues show reduced resolution time
- Troubleshooting knowledge is preserved and continuously improved
